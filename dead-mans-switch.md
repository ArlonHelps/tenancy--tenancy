# Dead mans switch

Hi,

My name is Daniël Klabbers, also known as @luceos, I am the owner
of project Tenancy. This document guarantees the survival of the Tenancy project by
transferring ownership to a valid successor in case I am no longer able to fulfil my
obligations in maintaining this package due to unforeseen circumstances (eg death).

Ownership is transferred to the candidate appointed by his peers
or last active candidate on the project of the following list:

- Arlon Antonius (NLD), @arlonantonius
- Eric Fletcher (USA), @fletch3555
- Bertrand Kintanar (PHIL), @bkintanar

In order to transfer ownership the following requirements have to be met:

1. Inactivity of the Owner for at least three months, based on:
  - GitHub activity.
  - Chat activity.
  - Forum activity.
2. Failed attempts of the Candidate to reach out to the Owner via phone and email
every day for two weeks.

Once both of these requirements have been met, the project is automatically transferred
to the Candidate and parties involved in this project should do everything in their power
to assist in this transfer.

The Candidate then is obligated to update this document to name him- or herself Owner
and appoint at least two new Candidates.

Hereby signed and committed as a legally binding agreement,

Daniël Klabbers
